Question: Can I use this code for my own website? 
Answer: Yes, with attribution.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. It's always disheartening without giving me credit. 

TL;DR
Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to https://x0samnan.live/ Thanks!
